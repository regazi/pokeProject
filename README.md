# pokeProject
This is my first achievement in the CareerFoundry 'Full-Stack Developer' course. 

THis app allows users to search/scroll through a list of pokemon, with the option to click on the
pokemon name and open a modal containing pokemon picture, types, height, and abilities. 

App fetches list of pokemon from pokeapp API.

No stylesheet included, all styling done with bootstrap classes. 

All dependencies (bootstrap 4.3.1, jquery 3.3.1, popper 1.14.7) linked via CDN.
